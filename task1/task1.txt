SECTION A: TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

1. Difference between var, let, and const

var:
- Function scoped
- Allows redeclaration
- Allows reinitialization

let:
- Block scoped
- Does not allow redeclaration
- Allows reinitialization

const:
- Block scoped
- Does not allow redeclaration
- Does not allow reinitialization


2. Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?
Answer:
var allows redeclaration because it is function scoped, and JavaScript does not
restrict redeclaring variables declared using var.


3. Which keyword allows reinitialization?
Answer:
var and let allow reinitialization.


4. Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
Answer:
const does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization.


5. Why should const be used for fixed values?
Answer:
const should be used for fixed values because it prevents accidental changes
and makes the code safer and more readable.


6. What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?
Answer:
SyntaxError occurs because let does not allow redeclaration in the same scope.


7. What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?
Answer:
TypeError occurs because const variables cannot be reassigned.


8. Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?
Answer:
let and const are preferred because they provide block scope and reduce bugs
compared to var.


9. Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.
Answer:
No, const cannot be declared without initialization because a value must be
assigned at the time of declaration.


10. When should var be avoided?
Answer:
var should be avoided because it is function scoped, allows redeclaration,
and can cause unexpected bugs.



SECTION B: CODE-BASED QUESTIONS

11. Predict the output:
Code:
var a = 10;
a = 20;
var a = 30;
console.log(a);

Output:
30

Reason:
var allows redeclaration and reinitialization.


12. Predict the output:
Code:
let b = 5;
b = 15;
console.log(b);

Output:
15


13. Identify the error:
Code:
let x = 10;
let x = 20;

Error:
SyntaxError

Reason:
Redeclaration of a let variable is not allowed.


14. Identify the error:
Code:
const y = 50;
y = 100;

Error:
TypeError

Reason:
const variables cannot be reassigned.


15. Program using var to show redeclaration:
Code:
var name = "Sai";
var name = "Venkatesh";
console.log(name);

Output:
Venkatesh


16. Program using let to show reinitialization:
Code:
let age = 21;
age = 22;
console.log(age);

Output:
22


17. Program using const and explanation:
Code:
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.14159;
console.log(PI);

Explanation:
const value cannot be changed after initialization, so it throws a TypeError.


18. Convert var to let:
Code:
let count = 10;
console.log(count);


19. Convert var to const:
Code:
const PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI);


20. Own example for var, let, and const:
Code:
var city = "Hyderabad";
let marks = 90;
const college = "JNTU";
